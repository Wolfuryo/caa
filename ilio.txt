Day dreaming, in clear images, looking for meanings
I forgot what it feels to be doing something fulfilling
Reminiscing being a kid, ugly hair, t-shirt, pair of jeans
And a duo of bullies I thought I'd smile if I get to outlive
Never stable, always labeled:smart, ugly, shy and queer
Dropping a tear everytime I saw myself in a mirror
Emotion shatters the glass, I select the sharpest shard
Stab straight through my heart and push the shyness out
No more obstacles in my way, nothing to block me
And if I find a limit I'm ready to break infinity
